### Hi there 👋🏼

My name is Sohaib and I am a Biomedical Scientist by profession but learning to code so that I can transition into the tech industry.


- 🌱 I have recently just finished a JAM Stack bootcamp with The Coders Guild. So now I am enjoying my journey of learning and understanding coding in my own time.
- More info coming soon....
